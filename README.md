This is a collection of notes, lesson plans, and programming practices originally organized for my grandson (when he was in elementary school) to learn Python.
It consists of several small course projects, with the programs gradually expanding and progressing step by step.
Every statement is annotated in Chinese, enabling learners to grasp and understand Python commands and structures through hands-on coding practice.
It is very suitable for elementary school students or beginners to learn while playing.
This project requires calling the Pygame module, so it is necessary to install the Pygame library in the Python environment.



这是原为我的孙儿(读小学时)学习 python 整理的笔记、教案和编程实践，
它由若干个课程小项目组成，程序逐步扩展深入、循序渐进，
每条语句我都用中文注释，
从一步步编码实践中掌握并体会 python 的命令与结构，
很适合小学生或初学者, 边学边玩。
本项目需调用 pygame 模块，故需要在python环境中额外安装 pygame 扩展库。
